   /*
   Determining equality in Java can be a nontrivial endeavor as there’s a semantic difference
    between
    “two objects are the same” and “two objects are equivalent.”


    the equals operator
    ==
    and not equals operator
    !=


        The equality operators are used in one of three scenarios:
            1. Comparing two numeric primitive types. If the numeric values are of different data
            types, the values are automatically promoted as previously described.
                For example, 5 == 5.00 returns true since the left side is promoted to a double.
            2. Comparing two boolean values.
            3. Comparing two objects, including null and String values.
